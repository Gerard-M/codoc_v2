# ⚡️ CODOC — *Code Smarter, Not Harder*

Ever wonder if your code is secretly **O(n²)** when you *swear* it's linear? 😅  
**CODOC** is your AI-powered code complexity sidekick — helping you analyze, refactor, and optimize like a pro ⚔️.

> ✨ Input code. Detect complexity. Refactor with AI. Battle for the most efficient solution.  
> 🧠 Learn, Play, and DOMINATE the complexity game.

## 🧩 What is CODOC?

**codoc_v2** is a web app that helps you:
- 🔍 **Analyze** your code’s time & space complexity
- 🤖 Get **AI-powered insights & refactors** to improve your code
- 📚 **Learn** about complexity through structured modules
- 🏆 **Compete** in coding challenges — the *lower* your complexity, the *higher* your score!

Think of it like **LeetCode meets AI code coach**, but your main goal isn’t just solving the problem — it’s solving it *beautifully* and *efficiently*.
